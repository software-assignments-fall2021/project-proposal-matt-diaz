***Project Proposal***

Title:
Photoden

What and why:
I would like to build a webapp interface for editing photos e.g applying filters, effects and drawing over them. This would be a very simple and beginner-friendly interface for simple photo editing.

For whom?:
The software is for mass consumers. Specifically, it's for people who want to modify their photos but lack access or familiarity with tools like photoshop and gimp.

How?:
A user would upload their photo, which would then bring up a gui with a panel of buttons that can be used to edit the photo.

Scope:
I think this project is relatively simple to accomplish minimally.  However, the difficulty and scale of the project can easily be augmented by adding more granularity to the editing.
